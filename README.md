# UFOs Analysis

#Overview of Analysis
Dana has a web page where UFO sightings are shown. She wants to be able to filter the data using multiple different criteria. The filters that have been asked to provide are date, city, state, country and shape. 
In order to do so, we will use JavaScript and HTML and modify the code for the index.html file that we already have worked on in Module 11. 


In order to create the new filters, we reference the code that is already in place for the "Enter Date" list element. We used functions such as buildTable and updateFilters to be able to change based on user input. In order to create some of the filters, we used if-else functions as well. 


# Results

There are multiple different filters for conducting a search. The first filter we can use is the date. For that filter, I chose the date 1/13/2010 amd clicked the "Filter Table" button.

The second filter I applied was to see all sightings on 1/10/2010 that took place in California. For this filter, I changed the state to CA. I also wanted to see how many sightings in California were shaped as a Sphere. So I applied the Shape filter as well. Below is the result.

#Summary

One Drawback of this webpage is that the filters don't have a drop down. So in order to filter by city, the user would have to scroll down and find the city to filter by. 

One recommendation would be to add a drop down for the user to filter by instead of typing. 
Another recommendation to view easier would be to allow for filters such as ascending/descending order of dates and all other fields.
