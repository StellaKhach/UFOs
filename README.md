# UFOs Analysis

#Overview of Analysis
Dana has a web page where UFO sightings are shown. She wants to be able to filter the data using multiple different criteria. The filters that have been asked to provide are date, city, state, country and shape. 
In order to do so, we will use JavaScript and HTML and modify the code for the index.html file that we already have worked on in Module 11.
