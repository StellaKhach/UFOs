# UFOs Analysis

#Overview of Analysis
Dana has a web page where UFO sightings are shown. She wants to be able to filter the data using multiple different criteria. The filters that have been asked to provide are date, city, state, country and shape. 
In order to do so, we will use JavaScript and HTML and modify the code for the index.html file that we already have worked on in Module 11. 


In order to create the new filters, we reference the code that is already in place for the "Enter Date" list element. We used functions such as buildTable and updateFilters to be able to change based on user input. In order to create some of the filters, we used if-else functions as well. 


# Results

There are multiple different filters for conducting a search. The first filter we can use is the date. For that filter, I chose the date 1/13/2010 amd clicked the "Filter Table" button.
